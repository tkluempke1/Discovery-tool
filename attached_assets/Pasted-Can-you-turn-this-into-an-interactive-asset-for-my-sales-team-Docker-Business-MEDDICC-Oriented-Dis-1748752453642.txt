“Docker Business MEDDICC-Oriented Discovery Guide
A practical, question-driven playbook for qualifying, forecasting, and advancing Docker Business opportunities
⸻
How to Use This Guide
Section    Purpose
Assumption    You are operating in a sales org that uses MEDDICC as its primary qualification framework and have a solid grasp of each component. This version translates generic discovery prompts into Docker-specific language so you can surface developer-productivity and software-supply-chain-security value quickly.
Meeting Preparation    Use the ~80 example questions below to plan discovery calls, pre-read emails, or executive briefings. Star or highlight the 3–5 most relevant questions for this buyer persona, stage, and account maturity (e.g., green-field vs. competitive displacement).
Customization    Each prompt is templated. Swap the X, Y, or metric names with concrete data from public filings, GitHub repos, incident post-mortems, or Docker Scout scans to boost credibility.
Example – Implicate the Pain → “In your June ‘24 status report you mentioned a 17-hour mean time to remediate CVEs in production. How does that impact release velocity today?” |
⸻
M – Metrics (Quantify the Business Impact)
    1.    Which engineering KPIs (e.g., lead-time-for-changes, MTTR, deployment frequency) would improve if every dev used a standard Docker Desktop + Docker Scout toolchain?
    2.    What revenue-critical services are blocked when container images fail security checks today?
    3.    What percent of your developer workday is lost to environment drift or “works on my machine” issues?
    4.    If we automated software-supply-chain scanning with Docker Business, how many high-severity CVEs could you remediate per sprint?
    5.    How will you measure success for this initiative—cycle-time reduction, CVE backlog burn-down, or something else?
    6.    Where do container misconfigurations currently surface in your incident-cost model (S1 downtime, SLA penalties, on-call hours)?
    7.    What’s the $ cost of maintaining multiple community editions versus a single managed subscription?
    8.    Where would you like that cost/KPI to be in 12 months?
    9.    Assuming you implemented Docker Business next quarter, what tangible business results would you call out in your next Ops review?
    10.    How would a best-in-class container platform influence your Net Promoter Score with engineering teams?
⸻
E – Economic Buyer (Identify Who Owns the Budget & Value Narrative)
    1.    Have you earmarked budget for developer tooling or supply-chain security in FY25?
    2.    How did you arrive at that figure? Was it based on incident cost or head-count productivity?
    3.    Which line-item (Dev Ops, AppSec, Cloud Ops) and which executive ultimately signs off on tooling that touches security and productivity?
    4.    Who is held accountable for the DevEx OKR we discussed earlier?
    5.    Which executive’s objectives are most impacted by environment drift or slow CVE remediation?
    6.    Who has final authority to approve a multi-year Docker Business subscription?
    7.    Who could veto the deal if they felt open-source Podman was “good enough”?
    8.    In the last 3 purchases over $100 k, how many times did the CFO push back for a stronger ROI model?
⸻
D – Decision Criteria (Shape the Required Capabilities)
    1.    Which capabilities must a solution include to deliver both secure supply-chain and developer velocity improvements?
    2.    What does your team need that they don’t get from the community edition today (e.g., SSO/SAML, centralized billing, image SBOMs)?
    3.    Is FIPS-validated crypto a non-negotiable requirement for production workloads?
    4.    Beyond security, what other pains should the platform resolve—license compliance, usage analytics, role-based access?
    5.    In an ideal world, how would onboarding new devs day 1 work?
    6.    Rank the importance of these factors: time-to-value, support SLAs, depth of ecosystem, cost per seat.
    7.    What criteria define an ideal enterprise container platform for your organization?
    8.    If price matters most, what premium would justify Docker’s integrated DevEx + security bundle over point tools?
    9.    When we work with companies like Stripe and Amgen, they require auditable SBOMs, granular RBAC, and 4-hour support. How do those map to your needs?
    10.    Will you need the chosen vendor to provide an attested base image pipeline (Hardened Images)?
⸻
D – Decision Process (Map the Buying Journey & Paper Process)
    1.    How long did your last developer-platform purchase take, end-to-end?
    2.    Who else (Security, Platform Eng, Finance) must be on board?
    3.    Can you outline each approval gate—from proof of value (POV) to red-line legal?
    4.    Who influences technical validation vs. commercial terms at each step?
    5.    Which documents (DPA, EULA, InfoSec questionnaire) need sign-off before PO issuance?
    6.    What could accelerate or stall the process—penetration test results, SOC 2 report, internal freeze?
    7.    Besides yourself, who needs to approve spend >$50 k annually?
    8.    What timeline are you targeting to hit production readiness before Kubernetes migration phase 2?
    9.    If we deliver a successful 30-day POV, what happens next?
    10.    Will procurement require a competitive RFP or can you sole-source based on POV results?
⸻
I – Implicate the Pain (Make Status-Quo Intolerable)
Current & Future State
    1.    How do you know container sprawl is a problem today?
    2.    How often do image-based vulnerabilities delay releases?
    3.    Why do you think environment drift keeps recurring despite existing scripts?
    4.    Where does this problem manifest—build pipelines, production, developer laptops?
    5.    What blocked previous attempts to standardize on a single platform?
    6.    Where does solving this rank among FY25 engineering priorities?
    7.    What are your goals around secure software supply chain this year?
    8.    How do you quantify the impact of late CVE remediation today?

    10.    Which strategic outcomes (e.g., faster FedRAMP path, reduced audit fatigue) are you targeting?
Positive Outcomes & Negative Consequences
    1.    How does inconsistent tooling impact on-call burnout or new-hire ramp?
    2.    Have you tried “DIY” hardening? What did that cost in head-count?

Pressing on “Why Now & Why Docker?”
    1.    Why solve this before the next major product launch?
    2.    What event or deadline forces resolution (board mandate, regulatory audit)?
    3.    What’s different this time—new executive mandate, breach near-miss, budget availability?
    4.    You’ve used open-source images for years; why not stay that course?

    2.    What do stakeholders like/dislike about those options?
    3.    How important is having all-in-one DevEx & security versus stitching point tools?
    4.    Has another vendor set the decision criteria or price anchor?

Next Steps & Best Practices
    •    Before every call – pick 2–3 questions per MEDDICC element; avoid interrogations.
    •    After each call – map answers into Salesforce MEDDICC fields, score health, and update close plan.
    •    Leverage Docker Scout & Hardened Images during discovery to show value (scan customer images, quantify risk).
    •    Practice – Role-play with peers; refine phrasing for different personas (Developer vs. CISO).
